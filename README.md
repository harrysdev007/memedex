**Your meme discovery terminal.** Search public sources, explore templates, and build a private meme library in your browser.

Memedex is a static web app. Search requests go from your browser to the configured public services. There is no Memedex account, analytics, or application server.

## What it does

- Search meme posts from Lemmy, Bluesky, Mastodon, and Reddit, plus Imgflip templates.
- Browse image, GIF, template, and combined search results. Sort results and filter by source.
- Open a result to visit its source, download or copy media, save it, find similar items, or caption a supported Imgflip template.
- Search by image with Memedex Lens.
- Keep a personal library in this browser: upload or save memes, add descriptions and tags, organize folders, and search with keywords or optional local embeddings.
- Generate image descriptions in the browser with Florence-2, or configure an OpenAI-compatible vision endpoint.
- Add your own API keys in Settings for optional Tenor, Giphy, and Imgur search. Keys are stored in this browser.

Search results and saved data have different storage: search results are fetched from their source, while uploaded and saved items stay in this browser unless you export them. External search providers receive the queries needed to return results. Review each provider's terms and privacy policy before use.

## Run locally

The app uses JavaScript modules and needs to be served over HTTP. Python 3 is sufficient:

```sh
python tools/serve.py
```

Then open http://127.0.0.1:8000. You can also use another static web server that serves JavaScript files with the correct MIME type.
